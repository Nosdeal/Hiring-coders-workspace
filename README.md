This is my repository to the Hiring coders bootcamp.

Here i'll share my learning. 

I've been learning a lot in this Bootcamp, and this is sensational 'cause the things don't need to be complicated. <br>
The professors are so clean in their explanations. 

In the first week i learned more about HTML, CSS, Data structure, Agile methodologies and Soft skilss.

<HTML>
    I learned some things very interisting, like separate the parts of an HTML archive.
      <header> Is the top;
      <body> The name speaks for itself;
      <footer> Is the bottom.
       
<CSS> 
    This bring life for the website, it's sensational because, if CSS dindn't exist the page would be so boring.
