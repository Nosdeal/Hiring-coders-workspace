This is my repository to the Hiring coders bootcamp.

Here i'll share my learning. 

I've been learning a lot in this Bootcamp, and this is sensational 'cause the things don't need to be complicated. <br>
The professors are so clean in their explanations. 

In the first week i learned more about HTML, CSS, Data structure, Agile methodologies and Soft skilss.

<- HTML -> <br>
    I learned some things very interisting, like separate the parts of an HTML archive. <br>
      <- header -> Is the top; <br>
      <- body -> The name speaks for itself; <br>
      <- footer -> Is the bottom. 
       
<- CSS -> <br>
    This bring life for the website, it's sensational because, if CSS didn't exist the page would be so boring.
